If I did not feel uncomfortable I could have overcome all the difficulties and taste the real joy.
But I understood clearly I would be kicked out of when they think I am not useful for the system.  

So, this is my plan.
If I can survive and enjoy working in this team within 6 months I will stay at the current team.
Otherwise, and if there are chances that the Helix team offers me remote working job in a year I would go to Helix team.
Reason is very obvious - I will do what I can do best.  Visa CAS processing, Visa Edit Package and SOAP programming are 
my special experties that no one can do better than I do.
If no chances are visible from Helix team and I still do not like current 'new' job, I will stay and try to do my best
to literarily survive.  Almost all the time developers can survive unless the management is really tough and bad.

If I cannot survive after 2-3 years I can seek other positions out of JPMC.  I would have the skill sets at that time that 
I can apply to other companies where the skill sets are required ones.
